"""
Step 1: Data Collection
-Get input packets time of entering mix network
-Get output packets time of arriving at node

Step 2: Flow Pattern Extraction
-Transform list of input packets and output packets into pattern vectors

Step 3: Distance Function Selection
-Determine the distance between the pattern vectors
-Distance Function 1: Mutual Information
-Distance Function 2: Frequency-spectrum-based matched filter

Step 4: Flow Correlation
-Selecting the OUTPUT link whose traffic has the minimum distance to INPUT flow pattern vector
