
In terms of implementation, we aim to replicate the flow correlation attack on a Mix network structure comprising of senders and receivers, where the senders' traffic will be routed through a mix node prior to delivery to the receiver. Subsequently, we will implement the flow correlation attack outlined in the paper by monitoring the aforementioned traffic and analyzing the timing of the messages to establish correlations with the messages sent by the adversary. This implementation will be based on the metrics discussed in the paper, which allow us to distinguish the data flow and thus extract the necessary information. Through this, we aim to evaluate the efficacy and success of the flow correlation attack by producing visual representations which compare the extracted information with the original data.
