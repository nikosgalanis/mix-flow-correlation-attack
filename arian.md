In this particular piece of research, the authors examine an attack technique known as flow correlation assault. 
During a flow correlation attack, an adversary examines the patterns of the network's traffic in an effort to 
discover the origin of a certain message that has been sent over the network. This can be accomplished by monitoring 
the traffic on the network and then analysing the timing, size, and other aspects of the messages in order to compare 
them with the messages that were sent by the person who is the object of the investigation. Mix networks are a type of 
anonymity network that are intended to safeguard users' privacy by rerouting their traffic through many nodes before it
reaches its final destination. Mix networks are also known as onion networks. It is difficult for a potential hacker to 
determine the origin of a given message when it is delivered through a mix network since the data from multiple users is 
combined and mixed together before being transmitted. However, flow correlation attacks can be used to pinpoint the origin 
of a message by taking advantage of flaws in the design or implementation of a network.
