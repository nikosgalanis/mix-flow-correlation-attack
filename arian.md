 - What the attack/vulnerability is about (Arian)

In the proposed paper, the authors examine flow corellation attacks on Mix networks.  During such an attack, an adversary examines the patterns of the network's traffic in an effort to achieve a corellation between the sender and the reciever of the message. This is shown to be accomplished by the authors by monitoring the traffic on the network and then analysing the timing of the messages in order to compare them with the messages that were sent by the person who is the object of the investigation. The comparison and representation is done with algorithms that then allow them to extract usefull information and thus launch a flow corellation attack.

The attack is implemented in Mix networks, a type of anonymity network that are intended to safeguard users' privacy by rerouting their traffic before it reaches its final destination. Originially, it was thought that it would be difficult for a potential adversary to determine the origin of a given message when it is delivered through a mix network since the data from multiple users is combined and mixed together before being transmitted. However, as shown in this paper, flow correlation attacks can be used to pinpoint the origin of a message by taking advantage of flaws in the design or implementation of such a network.
