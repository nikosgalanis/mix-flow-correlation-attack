 - Why you picked that paper (Nick)

In today's world, with the strong dependence of communication and human interaction in computers, there is a solid need for anonymity. In the efforts to establish a secure and private way to communiate with web servers anonymously, the Mix network was invented. The guarantees that it offered caught the eye of the scientific community, as at first it was thought that it was very hard to distinguish the flow of information that goes through such a network. However, the paper we selected, amongst other similars pieces of research come to exploit some serious vulnerabilities in the network, that successfully break the anonymity of its users.

Papers like the one we propose were state of the art at the time, and prevented the spread of using Mix networks as a secure way of communicating, something that ultimetly led the community to search different routes for achieving anonymity. Thus, we found the work presented in this paper very interesting as it applied to the real world by exploiting a very serious vulnerability of a sophisticated way to carry out online communications. More over, the data-analyzing aspect behind the flow corellation attack presented, intrigued us, as it shows that the right manipulation of anonymized data can lead to its deanonymization.
